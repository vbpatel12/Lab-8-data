The DIG Trial was a randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial with more than 300 centers in
the United States and Canada participating. The purpose of the trial was to examine the safety
and efficacy of Digoxin in treating patients with congestive heart failure in sinus rhythm. Digitalis
was introduced clinically more than 200 years ago and has since become a commonly
prescribed medication for the treatment of heart failure; however, there was considerable
uncertainty surrounding its safety and efficacy. Small trials indicated that Digoxin alleviated
some of the symptoms of heart failure, prolonged exercise tolerance, and generally improved
the quality of patients' lives. Unfortunately, these trials were generally small and although they
did focus on the effect of treatment on patientsâ€™ relief from heart failure symptoms and quality of
life, they failed to address the effect of treatment on cardiovascular outcomes. Questions about
the safety of Digoxin were also a concern. Digoxin toxicity is uncommon in small trials with
careful surveillance, however, the long-term effects of therapeutic levels of Digoxin were less
clear.
The DIG dataset consists of baseline and outcome data from the main DIG trial. In the main
trial, heart failure patients meeting the eligibility criterion and whose ejection fraction was 45%
or less were randomized to receive either a placebo or digoxin. Outcomes assessed in the trial
included: cardiovascular mortality, hospitalization or death from worsening heart failure,
hospitalization due to other cardiovascular causes and hospitalization due to non-cardiovascular
causes.
