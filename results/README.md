A probability matrix provides information regarding the probability of the patients having both CVD and hypertension, or the patients having CVD or hypertension
A probability matrix with the count of the patients having CVD and Hypertension was made. The probability matrix consists of both marginal probabilities and the joint probabilities of patients with CVD and Hypertension. 
Conditional probabilities can also be calculated using the data produced in the probability matrix.
